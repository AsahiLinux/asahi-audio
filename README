Linux Userspace Support for MacBook Pro J31x Internal Speakers

This archive enables a sane experience with the builtin speakers
on select Apple Silicon devices. The goal is to eventually support
all of them.

WARNING: WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE ART, EXPERIMENTING WITH THE SPEAKERS
         COULD CAUSE THEM TO EXPLODE. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW
         WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

Currently supported devices:
MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021)
MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) [NOTE: I haven't actually tested these FIRs on the
                                   16-inch. They should work, but may not sound
                                   optimal. If anyone would like to send me a
                                   machine for testing and calibration, feel
                                   free to do so!]


Prerequisites:
    - PipeWire
    - pipewire-media-session (WIREPLUMBER DOES NOT WORK!!!)
    - The latest linux-asahi kernel

Installation instructions:
    1. Before playing ANY audio via the internal speakers, ensure that the
       drivers are ALL turned down to 60 in alsamixer. Failure to do so could
       make your speakers explode. Once this is set, everything else here is
       safe.

    2. Ensure you have met the prerequisites.

    3. Copy the file 10-j31x-sink.conf to /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/

    4. Make a new directory called /usr/share/alsa/impulse/apple/j31x/

    5. Copy the contents of the FIRs directory in this archive to that folder

    6. Set the default audio device to the Pro Audio profile

    7. Reboot your machine

    8. In your desktop environment, make sure all audio is set to play through
       the newly created "MacBook Pro J31x Internal Speakers" device

    9. Enjoy some music


Special Thanks:
    povik:  for a working kernel driver

    marcan: for putting up with my insane ramblings on the state of the
            GNU/Linux audio stack in #asahi-dev

    whoever decided that PipeWire needed a built in convolver
